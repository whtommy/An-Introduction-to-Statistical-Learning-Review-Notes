Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised.

Supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs.
With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data. 

1.The Wage data involves predicting a continuous or quantitative output value. This is often referred to as a regression problem.
2.In certain cases we may instead wish to predict a non-numerical value—that is, a categorical or qualitative output. This is known as a classification problem

3.For example, in a marketing setting, we might have demographic
information for a number of current or potential customers. We may wish to
understand which types of customers are similar to each other by grouping
individuals according to their observed characteristics. This is known as a
clustering problem. Unlike in the previous examples, here we are not trying
to predict an output variable.

Notations
n to represent the number of distinct data points, or observations, in our sample.
p denote the number of variables that are available for use in making predictions.
let xij represent the value of the jth variable for the ith observation, where i = 1, 2,...,n and j = 1, 2,...,p.
i will be used to index the samples or observations (from 1 to n) and
j will be used to index the variables (from 1 to p).
